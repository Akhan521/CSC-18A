Comments:
This project was a fun and quick project that had me demonstrate
my understanding of various concepts, such as abstract classes 
as well as child classes. I also had to implement numerous
methods and utilize method overloading. In addtion, I also 
covered arrays, arithmetic operations, control constructs,
and looping constructs. This was based on a text adventure game
that had a text based interface, and it was meant to be a simple
game idea that would demonstrate my experience in all aspects of
this class. I really enjoyed just how much I was able to showcase
so many different concepts in one program. If I had to do this 
project again, I would add more levels and try to make the game
a lot more fun by adding some creative puzzles.
