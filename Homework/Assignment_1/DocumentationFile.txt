Instructions: Fill out your name under programmer name, the date and time you started the assignment, 
the date and time you completed the assignment, total hours you dedicated to the assignment (should be
a minimum of 1 1/2 hours for a good quality, well done assignment - rules of academic honesty apply for
this), and any constructive comments you have about the assignment (could be things you liked about the 
assignment; or if you had the opportunity to do the assignment all over again, what would you do 
differently?)

Comments: For cases where our ouputs are off by a cent or two, we could use doubles instead of floats for
more precision. We could also round our results using the round method to avoid any precision errors. 
Floating point values are never exactly the value they're assigned, they're close approximations. This
can lead to precision errors that may display your results incorrectly. I find this very interesting
because the computer can't store a floating point value as the exact value they're assigned directly. 
For this assignment, I really enjoyed working with the printf method as it seems like a very useful
method for printing formatted data. I also enjoyed using different variable data types as it will help me
get accustomed to the various data types avaiable in Java. If I had the opportunity to do this assignment 
again, I would attempt to work out the precision errors. This would allow me to output the same results
all the time, and they'd be more accurate in terms of precision/rounding.
