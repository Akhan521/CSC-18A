Comments:
For this assignment, I had to introduce exception handling
to assignment #6 - MonthDays. I basically had to throw an
IllegalArgumentException if an invalid value was entered
for either the month or year. It was a neat little exercise
that introduced me to try/catch blocks and the idea of 
exception handling. If I had to do this asignment again, I 
would keep reprompting the user for input until valid values
were entered for both variables.
