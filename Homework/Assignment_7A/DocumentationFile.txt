Comments:
This assignment was very helpful in understanding how to use enum constants. In addition
to creating constants, I also had to write a constructor, a getter method, and create a
variable to hold the duration of the constant. This taught me how to use parameterized 
constants to store custom values in my constants. Enum types seem very useful, and I can
see myself using it when I need to work with a set of pre-defined constants. It allows 
us to create named constants that we can reference using the name of the constant. If
I had to do this assignment all over again, I'd like to create some more methods for this
enum type. I'd also like to work with more parameterized enum types. I'd consider adding
some more parameters to my constants to store more information.
