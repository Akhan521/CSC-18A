Comments:
This assignment was a little more challenging and time-consuming. I got to work with
methods, so I enjoyed getting some experience of writing methods in Java. I also
had to wrap my head around what static methods are and why they are useful. The code
itself was self-explanatory and the goal was to be able to find the factors of a 
number and determine if that number was a perfect number. Prior to this assignment,
I didn't know what a perfect number was, so it was nice to pick up something new
through this assignment. If I was able to do this assignment all over again, I would
try to find another way to output the results more efficiently and quickly. I found
that it took a really long time for the program to output all perfect numbers when 
the max of our range was some really large integer value. This is because I have
several for-loops iterating through a large range of values.
