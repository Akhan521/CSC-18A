Comments:
This assignment provided me with some experience on using
abstract classes and interfaces. I was also expected to
do some research on the merits of using these two concepts
and what they have to offer. I made a simple program that
has one abstractclass and 2 abstract methods. In addition
to the abstract class, I also implemented a very simple
interface. If I had to do this assignment all over again,
I'd add more properties and methods to all of my classes.
I'd also create another interface named Prey to model animals
that are preyed on.
