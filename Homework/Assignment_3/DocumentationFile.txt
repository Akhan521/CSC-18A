Comments:
This assignment had me utilize iterating statements/structures, such as the while loop for input handling
and the for loop for outputting my table. The assignment wasn't too difficult, so I enjoyed the assignment
more than I was expecting to. I used an anonymous Scanner object in this program to read in input. I also
worked with format specifiers once again in order to line up my results in my table. If I had the
opportunity to do this assignment all over again, I would like to perform more complex calculations and
make this program an actual calculator for wages. What I was surprised with was the fact that I managed
to line up my results in as little as 2 attempts because I tend to struggle a lot when it comes to lining
up my results with format specifiers. I always try to rush tasks, and this leads me to miss small details.
I'll be practicing with format specifiers starting from now, so I hope to improve soon.
