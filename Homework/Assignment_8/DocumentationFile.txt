Comments:
This assignment was very simple and straightforward. I had to do a little research for this assignment,
and I had to try to understand some of the details behind using protected members versus private
members. I made a simple base class for this assignment and demonstrated inheritance through a 
simple derived class. If I had to do this assignment all over again, I would add more methods
and attributes to my derived class. I would also try to use some protected members. I liked how
different this assignment was from the rest in the sense that it ws left to us to be creative
about how we were to implement inheritance.
