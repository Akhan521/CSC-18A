Comments:
For this assignment, I was introduced to my first experience with classes in Java. Like C++, much
of it is the same, so I was able to pick up the syntax and practices quite quickly. I enjoyed
implementing getters and setters, and I was even able to implement a contructor in this 
assignment. The most challenging portion of this assignment was returning the number of days 
for the entered date, but it wasn't too difficult to execute. I was also able to get a 
refresher on how to determine leap years, so that was rewarding in a sense. I was introduced to
UML class diagrams, and I got some practice creating a UML diagram for this assignment.
It wasn't too hard to learn, and I've also had some prior experience with UML diagrams. If I had to 
do this assignment all over again, I would add some more methods to the class and clean up the test 
driver main class as much as possible.
