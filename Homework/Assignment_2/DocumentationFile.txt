Comments: 
Working with scanners has been a very educative experience as I'm starting to get comfortable
with them. This time around, I created anonymous scanner objects using the new keyword. 
Anonymous objects are like one-time use objects that exist only on the line they're declared. I
also had an introduction to branching statements, so I made sure to use several if statements
to determine the min and max of the values entered. After having learned c++, transitioning to
Java has been a breeze so far, and the syntax for branching statements is identical to c++.
I enjoyed being able to use simple logic to determine values such as the min and max. I hope
to write more complex logic in the coming weeks and demonstrate my understanding of branching
statements. I'm really interested in the idea of anonymous objects, so I look forward to using
more anonymous objects in future applications. However, I will admit that it does make the code
seem a little more complicated as the object isn't associated with a variable. In the end, I
saw this assignment as a quick refresher of my understanding of branching statements from c++.
