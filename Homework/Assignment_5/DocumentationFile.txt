Comments:
In this assignment, I was able to implement and pratice using variable length arguments, so that was
something new that I had to teach myself. It was an interesting task nonetheless, and I enjoyed
working with arrays for this assignment. I also brought forth my knowledge on methods to simplify
some of my programming logic. This assignment was very fun in the sense that it tested me on my
ability to perform some more complicated tasks, while working with arrays. I also loved that it
required me to implement printf and its format specifiers to align my results. If I had to do this
assignment all over again, I would clean up some of my code and try to make it more challenging
upon myself by implementing more methods that use variable length arguments. I find this concept
quite fascinating, and I could definitely use more practice with this concept.
