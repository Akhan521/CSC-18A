Comments:
This assignment was geared towards just giving me practice using BigDecimal objects.
All I had to do was rewrite the Account class to use BigDecimal objects instead of
doubles. I also had to utilize a few BigDecimal methods, such as the compareTo() and
add() methods. In addition to these methods, I also had to familiarize myself
with the BigDecimal constructor and the BigDecimal constants. The code was simply
copy-pasted, and I just made a few adjustments to have the program work with 
BigDecimals. If I had to do the assignment all over again, I'd clean up the test
driver program, ask the user for the number of deposits they wish to make, and 
loop through the deposits. I could even store the balances in an array of Account
objects. I would also love to incorporate variable length arguments in this program.
